# shortcode-plugin
A WordPress plugin that adds two new shortcodes to WordPress: [fibonacci length=1] (Printing fibonacci sequence at given length) and [fibonacci-reverse length=1] (Printing reversed fibonacci sequence at given length). Clicking the sequence in UI will save its value as post meta data called "fibonaaci_sequence" or "fibonacci_reversed" depending on the shortcode.
